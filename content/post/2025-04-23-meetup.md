### Description
Organizations often struggle with integrating new tools or technologies into existing workflows, even if those tools have the potential to boost productivity or benefit developers. This resistance can be due to unknown time commitments, fears of change, the pressures to deliver, or a lack of perceived need.

In this talk, we’ll look at the strategy behind our successful initiative to accelerate the adoption of GitHub Copilot within our development teams. From overcoming initial resistance to achieving rapid productivity gains, we’ll explore the lessons learned and the structured approach we used to foster adoption, collaboration, and long-term success. You will leave with actionable insights on how to create a culture of experimentation, incentivize learning, and create evangelists within your own teams—turning the challenge of integrating new technologies into an opportunity for growth.
