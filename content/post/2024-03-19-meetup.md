### Description
Hundreds of companies around the world are using Rust in production today for fast, low-resource, cross-platform solutions. Software you know and love, like [Firefox](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/08/inside-a-super-fast-css-engine-quantum-css-aka-stylo/), [Dropbox](https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2016/06/lossless-compression-with-brotli/), and [Cloudflare](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-workers-as-a-serverless-rust-platform/), uses Rust.

In this talk, Robert will provide an overview of the features, benefits, and downsides of the Rust programming language, aiming to highlight its strengths and where it can fit into your organization's tech stack.
