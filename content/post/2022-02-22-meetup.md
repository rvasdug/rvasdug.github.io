### Description
A big thank you to everyone who filled out the survey that was sent out after our first gathering of the year! It was pretty cool to see such an overwhelming response and we will kick off the February meetup with a review of the results.

As a warm up for the rest of 2022, we will spend a bit of time learning about an online code kata tool.

Following that, we will break out into small groups and practice doing a simple code kata. Finally, we will close out with a retro.

Do not worry about your level of coding experience or knowledge of a particular programming language. Just show up with an open mind, ready to have some fun.
