### Description
There is no magic bullet to getting a software engineering job. It's a 3-6 month process (or more) that you need to start way ahead of when you need a new job, and continue to maintain well after you've landed one. If you've been desperate, struggling with the job search process, or facing a layoff, this talk is for you. If you've been happily employed for a decade with the same company, this talk is ESPECIALLY for you, because you never know what will happen in this economy. But you CAN prepare yourself for whatever happens. Whether you're right out of college or have 20 years of experience, you need to set yourself up for success just the same. I'll break down the entire hiring process from first hearing about a job to securing the final offer. At each stage, you'll learn key techniques for advancing to the next round and what you need to do ahead of time to set yourself up for success. You'll learn actionable strategies for maintaining your employability even when you're gainfully employed, covering your resume, technical skills, and professional network. At the end of the talk, I'll open up to audience questions and do a sort of "employability clinic" to give advice for specific scenarios that you might be facing.
