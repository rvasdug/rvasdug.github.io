### Description
As we close out 2024, The Richmond Software Development Group is partnering with RVA.js and RVA Code & Coffee to hold a White Elephant Holiday party!

Everyone has that crazy uncle, step-parent, or brother/sister that is tough to shop for. Great opportunity to cross that special someone off your list or keep a gift for yourself!! This year's event will be held at Cabo Fish Taco in Scott's Addition where it will be Taco Tuesday - $4 signature tacos that are normally $14-16! You have to eat, right!! I'll grab a table (or tables) big enough to accommodate all that attend.

Sign up on the RVA Code & Coffee meetup page if you want to go!

Here is what we are doing:

1. It's a White Elephant Party so, White elephant rules apply - https://www.whiteelephantrules.com/
2. Wear your favorite Christmas Sweater, if you have one.
3. You can bring a guest, but please make sure everyone brings a gift for the exchange.
4. Everyone brings an UNMARKED & WRAPPED gift valued around $15 to share. I want to make it CLEAR that this doesn't have to be a brand, new gift. Some past gifts that we have seen:
    * a Javascript book
    * a Batman clock
    * [a set of Star Wars socks](https://a.co/d/ad4qptM)
    * Any kind of liquor
    * $15 in scratch-off lottery tickets (these should be brand new though)
    * [Nicolas Cage Reversible Pillow cover](https://amzn.to/3JwyzJs)
    * Gift Cards to Chipotle, Target, Amazon, etc...

It is sure to be a great night!! Looking forward to seeing everyone and celebrating!!
