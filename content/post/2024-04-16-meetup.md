### Description
CI/CD is more than just automating the build. It is about consuming change and releasing meaningful and reproducible software bound to the automation in your pipeline. Hands off release automation begins with the commit. In this presentation we will start, in some ways where my previous presentation on GitLab CI/CD left off and we take a deep dive to look at how mixed technology tooling can improve you and your team's commit habits, providing meaningful and semantic messages to enable end-to-end automation.
