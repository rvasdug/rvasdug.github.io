### Description
Agile is more than a development methodology, it is an approach, a mindset. Here are some truths: Developers whose companies follow an agile development methodology but don't have an agile mindset are not taking advantage of the benefits agile brings to an organization. Conversely, developers who adopt an agile mindset even when their companies may not embrace agile as a development methodology, derive much value from this mindset/approach, not just for themselves but for their team and organization. This meetup seeks to honestly speak truth to agile while focusing on developing that agile mindset as we understand the value it brings to the individual.
