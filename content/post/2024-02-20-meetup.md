### Description
Security bloggers and compliance folks love to talk about SBOMs (software bills of materials), but what is an SBOM? And more importantly, what is it good for? Come to this talk to learn to make and inspect SBOMs, and answer questions like: Are we running log4j? Are we running any open source code whose license could get us in trouble? Or maybe whose license terms recently changed? Is there a copy of this exact file anywhere in our production images? And many more.

In this talk, youâ€™ll learn to use Syft, a free and open source tool for generating SBOMs, to answer all these questions, plus Grype and Grant (also free and open source) to scan SBOMs for more detailed information about known vulnerabilities and license compliance.

### Speaker: Will Murphy
