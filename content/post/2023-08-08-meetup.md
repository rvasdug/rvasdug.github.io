### Description
Anyone developing frontend applications over the past two years has no doubt heard about micro-frontends, an application architecture that allows developers to divide an application up into smaller individually deployable applications that together make a whole by leveraging many of the long popular principles surrounding microservices. In this talk, we’ll discuss what micro-frontends are and what they aren’t, as well as how and, more importantly, when to implement them. Examples will be provided using Angular and Webpack 5’s Module Federation, however prior knowledge of these technologies is not required.

### Speaker: Evan Scott
