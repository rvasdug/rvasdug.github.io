### Description
This past year, Andrew Evans built an application to track his newborn's regular care. Starting with a simple React app and a DynamoDB table, Andrew expanded the app to cover all facets of the baby's care from daily feedings to height & weight. The app now includes integrations with Alexa via Home Assistant as well as statistical data graphing and tracking. In this meetup, Andrew will walk through how the app works, and how it leverages many AWS services to help him care for his new son.
