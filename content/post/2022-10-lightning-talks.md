* __How to Ship Less JavaScript - with Astro!__ by _Michael Marino_

Astro lets you write your websites in the language or library you feel most comfortable in - whether that's React, Vue, Svelte, whatever - and compiles it down to just HTML & CSS so you ship 0kb JavaScript by default. Of course you can opt-in when you need to, and the dev server is based on Vite so you know it's fast. Come find out how easy it can be to build fast websites, with tools built for the modern web!

* __Webhooks with Google Dialog Flow__ by _Jainit Harsora_
  * __Abstract:__ Google Dialog Flow is an Artificial Intelligence interface where we can design the system to have life like conversations. It uses natural language processing to understand and interact with the users for seamless communication. Along with some of its cool features, we can also validate complex/custom data given by the users using webhooks. This allows us to dissociate and associate back with Dialog Flow, strengthening the validation process.
