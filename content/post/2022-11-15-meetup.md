### Description
We kicked off the return of in-person events in 2022 with a social in May. Let’s wind the year down with another social!

Join us and network with other professionals in the local software development community. Chat about technical topics and industry gossip. Provide suggestions for future events to the organizers.

Feel free to drop in anytime between 6 and 8 PM. You don't have to stay the whole time either.
