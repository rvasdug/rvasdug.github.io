### Description
**The Business Problem**  
In the real world, AI solutions work crosses documents, systems, and approvals. You need agents that can plan, look things up, challenge each other, and show their work with clear guardrails.  
**The Tools**  
Lightweight orchestration that explores options before acting  
Retrieval and memory so answers are grounded in your corpus  
**The Takeaways**  
A copy-able reference architecture for multi-agent work  
A starter path - add retrieval, add a critic, add review, then instrument quality
