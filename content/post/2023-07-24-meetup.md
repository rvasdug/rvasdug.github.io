### Description
At this point in history, few questions remain on implementing Application Programming Interfaces. Our API journey has spanned over five decades, during which we have iterated through dozens of implementations. That experience taught hard lessons that led to an industry-wide consensus of defaulting to **RE**presentational **S**tate **T**ransfer and handling special cases with protocols such as ProtoBuff and Parquet.

This presentation will go beyond the well-established implementation details of REST and RPC to discuss how organization and structure impact the integrator's Developer Experience. Some questions we'll cover include:

* How should we define "Developer Experience"?
* What design choices improve or impede Developer Experience?
* Are there ways to reduce how often we version?
* Why does "API First" often deliver less than is hoped?
* How do we apply these concepts in a microservice world?

If your product competes in the marketplace based on its integration features, then this discussion should directly apply to your daily decisions.

### Speaker: Adam Lenda
Adam Lenda's path to software engineering began in 1997. While enthusiastic about the scientific aspects of computer science, he has spent his professional life architecting, implementing, and delivering custom business software.

Highly motivated to pass on the knowledge he finds useful, Adam's previous presentations, "Managing Technical Debt" and "Lessons from 20 Years in Software Engineering," concentrated on applying soft skills to I.T. leadership and facilitating difficult projects.

Adam's experience, leading API architecture for a SaaS-scale big-data platform, has motivated recent presentations on Software Sustainability as it applies to internal solution implementation (living requirements through Gherkin-driven unit testing) and external systems integration (API Design Fundamentals and Workflow Optimized APIs).

Looking forward, Adam is researching SaaS-scale requirement management strategies that empower autonomous microservice teams to make independent decisions that integrate into a coherent product with a consistent user and integrator experience.
