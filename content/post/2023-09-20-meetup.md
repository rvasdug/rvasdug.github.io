### Description
"Going the extra mile isn't just what we do - it's who we are". It is from this mindset that Estes Express Lines was able to grow from the one-man trucking operation founded in 1931, to being the largest privately held freight transportation company in North America, however; rapid growth and success do not come without challenges. In order to continue supporting their scaling business and operations, Estes's IT Department needed to evolve.

Please join us as we hear about Estes IT's Agile transformation story presented through the eyes of a new Software Engineer. Listen in as he talks about the initial state of IT teams upon his entry, the trials and triumphs they have experienced, their current state, and finally the aspiring vision for Estes IT as an integrated business unit in 5 years.

### Speaker: Keeshawn Sun
Keeshawn Sun graduated with a bachelor’s degree in computer science from George Mason University in the spring of 2019. He is currently employed as a Software Developer at Estes Express Lines, and although he specializes primarily in Java development, he is actively working towards his goal of becoming a full-stack engineer. Outside of software development, his passion for learning and helping others has placed him into various other roles at Estes.

He is an active board member of the Engineering & Quality Center of Improvement, working to define and document software development and testing best practices and standards. Furthermore, he also plays a vital role within the Engineering & Quality Community of Practice, where he facilitates innovation by providing a supportive environment for his peers to openly exchange knowledge and ideas.
