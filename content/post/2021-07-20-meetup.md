### Description
The reality of today’s digital landscape is that customers want to interact with corporations and other large-scale organizations across multiple channels. To further complicate matters, younger generations of customers demand well designed, modern digital capabilities. Millennials and younger generations are much more likely to move on to another provider if an organization does not meet their demands. This situation is particularly acute in the banking vertical. Banks face increasing pressure from fintechs to modernize their systems or lose a generation of would-be customers.
But how do we build new capabilities and support or enhance existing capabilities in this complex world? During this talk, I will set the stage for how we got here. Then I will discuss some approaches that have proven to be effective over the last several years.

### Speaker: Art Muthiora
Art is an experienced translator of business intent to IT implementation and now more recently of IT infrastructure, operating models and architecture to business value. With over 20 years of experience in roles that straddle business and IT, Art has witnessed quite a transformation across a wide range of segments.

Over the last 10 years or so, Art has led initiatives in Mobile Application Development, API adoption and Strategy and Data Engineering and Architecture. Art has also led initiatives focused on team topologies with a focus on creating autonomous teams that drive more value. Somewhat related to decentralized and distributed teams is the idea of managing decentralized components as products. Art is passionate about helping organizations to yield more value as they migrate to the cloud.
