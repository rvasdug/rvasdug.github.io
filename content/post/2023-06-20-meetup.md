### Description
On December 10th, 2021, the world learned about a critical zero-day vulnerability in Log4j circulated by the name "Log4Shell". Apache gave Log4Shell a [CVSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerability_Scoring_System) severity rating of 10, the highest available score. Rob will describe the Log4j defect and its implications, and how to protect against it and such defects in the future.

*Added bonus: As an Apache committee member, Rob was privy to some details that were not publicly known and might share them if we ask nicely.*
