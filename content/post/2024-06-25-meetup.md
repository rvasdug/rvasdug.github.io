### Description
When developing any software application, testing is critical to success. Even if only done manually, applications must be tested before they can be shipped to customers. Playwright is an automation library from Microsoft that enables developers to build automated tests for web applications. These automated tests can allow teams to quickly regression test features, and validate new changes. Playwright has a robust set of features that include reports and other artifacts that teams can share with stakeholders. Playwright also has a low learning curve, and an intuitive feedback loop for development.

In this presentation, Andrew Evans will be covering the basics of Playwright and how your team can leverage it for projects. Andrew will also discuss some experiences he's had using Playwright in both small and Enterprise level applications.
