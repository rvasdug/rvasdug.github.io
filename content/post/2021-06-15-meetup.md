### Description
As serverless computing becomes a staple of the modern technology stack, having frameworks like "Serverless" (https://www.serverless.com/ & https://github.com/serverless/serverless) to help you manage all of your resources becomes a necessity if you don't want to write tons of CICD code. We will go over some interesting examples of how to quickly and easily create microservices in AWS using Serverless.
