### Description
RSVP to join us for Pizza, networking, and a talk from Anil Palat about building Enterprise Application Integration software using modern techniques.

Entando is a cutting-edge platform engineered to turbocharge the development of modern web applications. It's based on a microservices architecture, allowing for scalable and flexible applications. What's exciting for engineers is that Entando seamlessly integrates with Docker and Kubernetes, enabling familiar, containerized deployments. It also champions DevOps practices with robust CI/CD support, automating testing and deployment, while its clear separation of frontend and backend simplifies development. Entando is all about empowering software engineers to excel in the rapidly evolving landscape of modern application development.
