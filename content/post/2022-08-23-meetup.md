### Description
At the last meetup, we came up with a list of great project ideas.
[https://github.com/rvasdug/projects/blob/main/2022-project-ideas-list.md](https://github.com/rvasdug/projects/blob/main/2022-project-ideas-list.md)

Let's get together to discuss a couple of them and come up with an execution plan. Then we will kick them off with some live coding!

Please bring your laptops.

Do not worry about the level of your technical skills. We are open to beginners as well as experts.

Even if you missed the last event, please join us if you are interested in contributing.
