### Description
Have you been longing for an in-person event? Let's ease into our first one in over 2 years with a casual get together at the Hardywood Brewery in Goochland.

No planned agenda. So come join us for some low key networking and a few cold beverages.

Feel free to drop in anytime between 6 and 8 PM. You don't have to stay the whole time either.

Terazo is sponsoring the event. A few of their reps will be present to answer any questions you may have about the company or career opportunities there. There will also be some free swag like t-shirts and stickers. Please check them out at https://terazo.com/.
