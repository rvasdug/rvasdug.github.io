### Description
Developing applications for the cloud presents a new set of problems for engineers and teams. From handling cloud-based service dependencies like queues and blob storage to spinning up new environments all locally, building an app for the cloud is challenging and can really create drag for a team.
Using modern tools like Docker containers, Terazo Lead Software Engineer Michael Blakeney digs into some of the tactics that can be used to effectively mitigate common issues to help your team accelerate its development.
