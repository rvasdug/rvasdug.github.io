### Description
In recent years, the integration of AI into the software development landscape has revolutionized the way we work. With diverse fields such as computer vision, machine learning, deep learning, speech recognition, and reinforcement learning, AI offers a wealth of powerful tools and APIs that many of us have already started incorporating into our workflows. However, a groundbreaking advancement in deep learning known as large language models (LLMs) has ushered in a new era, exemplified by game-changing tools like Github Copilot and OpenAI ChatGPT that possess the ability to comprehend and generate code. The impact is profound.

Now, you might wonder, will AI replace our jobs? Not today. But it unequivocally underscores the need for us to intelligently harness these tools to maintain a competitive edge. Join us in this captivating session as we explore a plethora of AI-driven tools that can instantaneously enhance your productivity. Let us empower you with knowledge, unveiling how AI can propel your development process forward. (This abstract has been meticulously refined by ChatGPT.)
