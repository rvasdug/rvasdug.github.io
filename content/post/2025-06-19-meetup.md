### Description
Java’s evolution is remarkable, and the leap from JDK 17 to today brings a wealth of powerful features to elevate your projects. Join us for an exciting session to explore select JEPs (Java Enhancement Proposals), diving into their use cases and practical benefits for your work or open-source initiatives.

**What You’ll Learn:**
How to enable and utilize advanced Java features introduced in JDK 24. Real-world demonstrations of cutting-edge updates, including:

* Stream Gatherers: Handle complex data streams with ease.
* Statements Before super(): Test invariants without constructing objects.
* Unnamed Variables and Parameters: Enhance code readability and maintainability.
* Launch Multi-File Source-Code Programs: Rapidly prototype with multiple source files.
* Implicitly Declared Classes & Enhanced Main Methods: Streamline application development.
* Updates on switch Expressions: We will discuss pattern matching as well as dealing with primitives
* If time remains, Structured Concurrency and Scoped Values. Additional concurrent APIs that are used with Virtual Threads.

**Please note that this event will be held at Vaco.**
