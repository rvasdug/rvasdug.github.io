### Description
When we hear 'AI' in 2025, we tend to think chatbots and API calls to massive Large Language Models. But powerful intelligence in your application doesn’t always require the network latency, cost, and conversational overhead of an LLM. This talk explores the "other" side of AI: silent, efficient machine learning that runs directly inside your JavaScript code.

Machine learning is no longer just the domain of Python developers. With a maturing ecosystem of JavaScript-based ML tools—from versatile libraries like Danfo.js for data modeling, to neural network builders like Synaptic.js, and working with Natural Language Processors using Natural.js—developers can now build and deploy powerful models directly within their existing JavaScript stacks. This talk explores how to bring intelligence into your JavaScript applications.

### Speaker: Laurie Lay
Laurie is a senior software engineer at Ippon Technologies, where she specializes in front-end development and software solutions that drive both user engagement and business success. She is particularly passionate about the impact of emerging technologies and their potential to accelerate development cycles and improve productivity. She is an advocate for learning, both for herself and others, and enjoys helping her colleagues discover their own learning paths and growth opportunities. When she's not coding or mentoring, Laurie enjoys time spent outdoors, taking hikes with her dog in the mountains or at the ocean, and generally running around anywhere without a leash—metaphorically and literally.
