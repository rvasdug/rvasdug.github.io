### Description
Test-Driven Development (TDD) has long been recognized as a best practice in software development, allowing developers to write robust and reliable code with confidence.

In recent years, GitHub Copilot has emerged as a groundbreaking tool that promises to revolutionize the coding experience. This AI-powered companion aims to automate many aspects of coding, including code completion, debugging, and even testing.

In this talk, we'll explore the exciting intersection of TDD and GitHub Copilot, showcasing how this powerful tool can be leveraged to accelerate your development workflow. We'll discuss how Copilot's AI-driven capabilities can assist in writing high-quality tests, ensuring that your code is robust and reliable from day one.
