### Description
You may have heard of Test Driven Development (TDD) and its benefits. You may even have tried using it with your hobby projects. But if you are like me, you probably decided it was too difficult to apply in real world projects.

Adopting powerful patterns such as "Fake It Until You Make It" by Kent Beck can ease some of that pain. In this session, we will learn a specific approach to implement this pattern. Then we will split up into small teams and practice using it in a coding kata exercise. All you will need is a web browser.

Do not worry about your level of coding experience or knowledge of a particular programming language. Just show up with an open mind, ready to have some fun.
