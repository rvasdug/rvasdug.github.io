### Description
From the experience gained by holding 50 events and navigating a disruptive pandemic, we think it is a good time to hit the reset button and reimagine the future of this group.

Agenda:
Sujith will propose a new vision for the meetup based on the following three core values.
- Community
- Craftsmanship
- Contribution
He will then solicit suggestions on the types of events and activities that might fit that vision. He looks forward to fostering an active discussion and receiving honest feedback from the attendees.

Please come prepared with your ideas and an open mind.
