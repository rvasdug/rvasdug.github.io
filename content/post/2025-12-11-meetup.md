### Description
It's time for our annual White Elephant Holiday Party! And this year, we are looking to make it even bigger and better! We are going to celebrate the holidays with our friends from RVA.js, RVA Code & Coffee and the Richmond Java User Group!
Please RSVP in whichever meetup group you choose, but only do it once. And guests are welcome to attend, but everyone must have a gift!

We are going to hold it at Starr Hill Brewery in Scott's Addition on Thursday, December 11th from 5:45 PM until 8:30 PM. Starr Hill has reserved us a couple of tables and a stand up bar section in the back of their taproom.

**NEW THIS YEAR - If you wear a Christmas sweater, we will buy you a beer!** And for food options, you have a choice! Starr Hill has a limited in house menu OR you can scan a QR code and order directly from Tazza Kitchen and they will deliver your meal to you.

And **for the MAIN EVENT - The White Elephant Gift Exchange** we ask that you bring an unlabeled, WRAPPED gift valued around $20. This CAN BE a Re-Gift OR a brand new Gift - your choice! Historically, the best gifts have seemed to be Funny (these gifts often make a big splash, but aren't the best for swapping), Weird (quirky artwork and gadgets are often highly sought after) and Nice ( a genuinely nice gift has the potential to fuel a lot of competition during the game). The gift should not be things you have used that are sitting around your house. That is called junk.

Some gifts that we have had in the past that fit these categories are: Gift Cards to Target, Amazon, Starbucks, etc.., a bottle of liquor, scratch off lottery tickets, a Batman Clock, 6 pairs of Star Wars socks, Charcuterie starter kit, gourmet popcorn kit, mini waffle maker, breakfast sandwich maker, fuzzy throw blanket that looks like a tortilla (or not), large scented candles, party card games, hot sauce sampler.
