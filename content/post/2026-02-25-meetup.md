### Description
As a tech lead, you will be faced with shifting requirements, tight timelines and unexpected complexities while bridging the gap between business goals and engineering realities. But your primary concern should be keeping your team motivated and performing at a high level without drifting into burnout.
Fortunately, there already are many established software development patterns and practices designed to help teams develop quality products efficiently. Additionally new tools are constantly hitting the market, each promising faster and cheaper delivery. How do you find the strategies that work for your team?
In this talk, Sujith will share lessons from years of experience in software delivery both as a creator and a consumer of business value. He will walk through a practical rubric he uses to choose the appropriate processes, practices, and tools for specific situations. You will learn how to apply this approach yourself - so you can build a framework that empowers your team and drives lasting stakeholder satisfaction.

This is a joint event with the [Richmond Java Users Group](https://www.meetup.com/richmond-java-users-group/).
