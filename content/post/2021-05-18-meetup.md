### Description
Go has rapidly become the preferred language for cloud development. Because of this, many developers are curious about learning Go and wonder how their existing skills and knowledge maps to Go. This talk starts with a quick tour of Go, the motivation for its creation and an overview of its features.

In addition, we'll also take a deep dive into one of Go's more controversial features - how it implements error handling.

### Speaker: Jon Bodner
Jon has been a software engineer, lead developer and architect for over 20 years. In that time, he has worked on software across many fields, including education, finance, commerce, healthcare, law, government, and internet infrastructure.

Jon is a Distinguished Engineer at Capital One, where he has contributed to their development and testing workflow, developed patented techniques for web payment page detection and population, and co-authored tools for finding and managing software development issues.
