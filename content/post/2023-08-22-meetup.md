### Description
It's time for our annual social. Let's get together at the [Main Line Brewery](https://www.mainlinerva.com/) for cold beverages and hot pizza.

No planned agenda. Just network with other professionals in the local software development community. Chat about technical topics or industry gossip. Provide suggestions for future events to the organizers.

Feel free to drop in anytime between 5 and 8 PM. You don't have to stay the whole time either.

Triumph Services is sponsoring the event and will get your first beer. A few of their reps will be present to answer any questions you may have about the services they offer.
