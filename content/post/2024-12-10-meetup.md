### Description
**Ensemble programming** (sometimes informally called **mobbing**, **mob programming** or **software teaming**) is a software development approach where the whole team works on the same thing, at the same time, in the same space, and at the same computer. This is similar to [pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming "Pair programming") where two people sit at the same computer and collaborate on the same code at the same time. With mob programming, the collaboration is extended to everyone on the team, while still using a single computer for writing the code and inputting it into the code base.

This is a beginner-friendly session that introduces ensemble programming with a dash of TDD. You will learn to code collaboratively with others in real-time, how to talk about your code and the basics of the red-green-refactor cycle of writing tests first.

Come ready to participate and get your hands dirty! Leave your laptop at home. No prior experience in specific programming language necessary.
