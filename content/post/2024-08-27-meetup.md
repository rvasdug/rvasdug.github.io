### Description
Homomorphic encryption is a groundbreaking technology that allows computations on encrypted data without needing to decrypt it, preserving privacy and security. This presentation will cover the fundamentals of homomorphic encryption, including basic concepts and potential applications. Additionally, we will demonstrate a practical case study showcasing how homomorphic encryption enables secure, collaborative analysis of sensitive data. Attendees will gain an understanding of the technology and its real-world implications through both theoretical insights and a detailed demo.

### Speaker: John Matter
John Matter is a Senior Research Scientist at ODU's School of Cybersecurity, specializing in machine learning and homomorphic encryption. With a PhD in experimental nuclear physics from UVA and previous experience at Meta, he has extensive experience with advanced computational models and secure data analysis techniques.
