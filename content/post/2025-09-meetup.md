### Description
If you are interested in getting exposed to a variety of software development related ideas in a condensed window, this is the event for you. Come and support your peers in the community as they give short interactive talks on topics they are passionate about.

### Talks
- **Ask Your Developers If Elixir Is Right For You** by _Aleksandr Podyachev_
  - **Abstract:** Elixir is a functional programming language that compiles to Erlang's BeamVM Bytecode. Elixir has a Ruby like syntax, but has some powerful features. It is able to be updated without restarting the VM. It is also good at handling faults using the let it fail philosophy that let's it handle errors with grace. Tt is also great at handing concurrent workloads and I/O operations.
  - **Speaker Bio:** Aleksandr Podyachev is a Software Developer at Booz Allen Hamilton. He has a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science from Virginia Commonwealth University. His interests include Elixir, Web Frameworks, Physics, and Game Development. He lives in Williamsburg, VA with his family playing Halo and thinking of new ideas to create.

- **A Cheapskates Guide to AWS** by _Michael Soh_
  - **Abstract:** Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers many services but it can be hard to know what provides the best value.  Michael will provide his experience in using AWS now for just over 10 years for his "LAMP" stack and how to best use the cloud while keeping an eye on your monthly spend.
  - **Speaker Bio:** Michael is deeply passionate about open-source software, so don't get him started on it!  (Or do if you want to get an ear-full!)  With a background in web development, he works as a resiliency engineer, building applications that can sustain infrastructure disruptions at scale.  When not in front of a screen, Michael enjoys gardening and taking his kayak out.

- **How to add a map to your website without paying Google or Mapbox \$\$\$** by _Daniel Schep_
  - **Abstract:** In this talk I will cover the available software and services that enable you to add mapping to your services that are free or easy to self-host.
  - **Speaker Bio:** Daniel is a software engineer at onX Maps, amateur cartographer, and co-founder of MapRVA.

- **Lessons learned building agent and agentic developer tooling** by _Luke Adams_
  - **Abstract:** Agentic systems are changing how we build and extend software, but the path from experimentation to practical developer tooling isn’t always straightforward. In this talk, I’ll share lessons learned as a senior engineer new to agentic development—covering both the use of existing agent frameworks and the process of building custom agent tools. I’ll highlight the incremental practices that proved most valuable, pitfalls to avoid, and best practices that emerged along the way. Whether you’re just starting out or already exploring agentic workflows, you’ll come away with concrete insights for making agents more effective, reliable, and developer-friendly.
  - **Speaker Bio:** Senior Distinguished Engineer at Capital One focusing on building developer tools and experiences.

- **Go for Non-Go Developers** by _Caroline Seng_
  - **Abstract:** As a seasoned and "comfortable" Java professional, I was curious about Go, but didn't know how it stacked up against the tools I already knew. In this presentation, I'll take you through the highlights of my first few months working with Go. We’ll discuss what surprised me, what felt familiar, and where Go truly shines. This talk is perfect for any developer (Java or otherwise!) who wants to see how Go works in the real world and decide if it's the right language for their next project.
  - **Speaker Bio:** Caroline Seng is a software engineer with a passion for building robust and supportable applications. With over 10 years of experience in web application development, she has a depth of experience in Java development, and, more recently, acquired a foundational understanding of Go. When not programming, you can find her outdoors jogging or hiking, or cozy on the couch with the latest crochet project.
