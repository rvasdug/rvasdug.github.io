### Description
Since mini-projects were a top choice among the activity ideas from the kickoff survey, we would like to come up with a concrete plan to get started.

The purpose of this session is to brainstorm ideas for mini-projects. We will discuss the following topics:

* Project ideas
* Personal goals
* Community goals
* Languages, frameworks and tools
* Collaboration practices

Please come prepared with your ideas and suggestions.

To support maximum participation, we are switching back to a virtual format for this event.
