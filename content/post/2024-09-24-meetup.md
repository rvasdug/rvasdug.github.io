### Description
Join us for an evening of casual socializing with the local software development community. No presentations, only conversations. Enjoy the fine beverages offered by Main Line Brewery and the company of your peers.

Special thanks go to our sponsor [Triumph Services](https://triumphjobs.com/) for providing the refreshments and covering everyone's first drink. To celebrate their 15 year anniversary, they will give away a $100 Visa Gift Card at the end of the event.

Hope to see you there!
