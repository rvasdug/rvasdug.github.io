### Description
The Richmond Software Development User Group is doing a collaborative social event with a few other local meetups - RVA Code & Coffee, RVA.js, and the Women’s Coder Coalition (formerly Women Who Code) on Thursday, July 25th for a Night at the Flying Squirrels.

This event is open to ALL members of the aforementioned meetups (as of July 1st, 2024) and their families, partners, and friends. Tickets are $10 and will need to be purchased by the Meetup Organizer to get the group rate. You will need to send a Venmo to @ GaelenKash or @ Sujith-Paul for each ticket that you would like to secure. The Venmo will need to have the member’s name, the number of tickets, and which meetup group you are a part of. For each ticket purchased and used, the meetup groups will refund $5 (half the cost of the ticket) for each member ticket and we will refund $3 for each ticket used for family members, partners, and friends.

This is a great opportunity to have some fun within our tech communities and get to know some of the people in the other tech communities as well. I feel that it is important for everyone to engage with others in the community and let others know who they are outside of business hours. Each of us is so much more than a developer, engineer, project manager, business analyst, etc… (even a recruiter). It’s when we foster these relationships that our connections to each other become deeper and more meaningful.

I look forward to seeing who will be attending and who is excited to Have Fun and Go Nuts! Let me know if you have any questions.
