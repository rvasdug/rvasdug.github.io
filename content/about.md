description: What is RVASDUG?
---

The **RVA Software Development User Group** was formed to share ideas about new technology stacks and development practices with students and developers of all skill levels. Most of our presentations are beginner-friendly, so even if you are new to the topic, you will still get something out of it. Occasionally, we will have more advanced talks too.

Our events focus on software development using a variety of programming languages, platforms and tools, including C#, Java, Go, Rust, TypeScript and JavaScript frameworks such as React, Angular and Vue. We also try to cover related topics ranging from architecture, security and DevOps to career development.

Our speakers are professionals from the local and regional communities who are passionate about technology and enjoy sharing their knowledge with fellow developers.

Our values are:

* COMMUNITY
  * A supportive group of peers and mentors
  * Cultivate a sense of belonging
* CRAFTSMANSHIP
  * Focus on developing skills
  * A safe space to learn, practice and collaborate outside of work
* CONTRIBUTION
  * Give back to local organizations
  * Free and Open Source software first
